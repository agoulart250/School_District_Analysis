# School_District_Analysis

Overview of the school district analysis: 
The purpose of this project is to provide the school district with an analysis of its 9th to 12th grade students performance in the subjects of math and reading. 
After concerns over academic dishonesty for Thomas High School 9th graders, the school district has requested that the grades for this student group to be removed from the performance data in an effort to normalize the analysis for fair performance comparisons.

## Results: 

## How is the district summary affected?
![](./Resources/district summary.png).
The district overall passing percentage dropped from 65.2% to 64.9%. This was a result of passing math stundent percentages changing from 75.5% to 74.8% and passing reading percentages dropping from 85.8% to 85.7% respectively.

### How is the school summary affected?
In the school summary the only school affected by the changes is Thomas High School (THS). THS overall passing percentage improved from 90.948% in the previous version to 91.095% in the newly adjusted version.

## How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

## Summary: 
![](.Resources/summary.png).
In this assignment portion of the exercise we 've replaced the reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs in an effort to produce an analysis that is potentially free of incorrect data.
As a result of these updates the four major data points were changed in the updated school district analysis. As displayed on the graph above, the average reading score, % passing math, % passing reading and % overall passing all improved at least a percentange point.
